// Package hippocampusexporter implements an OpenTelemetry Collector logs exporter that stores log
// records as Hippocampus memories over the service's gRPC contract. Each log record becomes a
// memory whose significance is derived from the record's severity, so the Hippocampus consolidation
// (decay) cycle forgets routine low-severity noise first and keeps errors. Optionally, records are
// bucketed into events keyed by configurable resource/log attributes.
